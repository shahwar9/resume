% IMPORTANT: THIS TEMPLATE NEEDS TO BE COMPILED WITH XeLaTeX
%
% This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by
% default. If you get compilation errors saying a font is missing, find the line
% on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
% operating system or comment the line out to use the default font.

% TODO:
% 1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.
% 2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
% 3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
% 4. Add location/address information
% 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.
% 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% CHANGELOG:
% v1.1:
% 1. Fixed several compilation bugs with \renewcommand
% 2. Got Open-source fonts (Windows/Linux support)
% 3. Added Last Updated
% 4. Move Title styling into .sty
% 5. Commented .sty file.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Known Issues:
% 1. Overflows onto second page if any column's contents are more than the
% vertical limit
% 2. Hacky space on the first bullet point on the second column.

\runsubsection{Borealis AI}
\descript{| Software Engineer }
\location{July 2019 - Present | Waterloo, ON}
\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
\begin{tightemize}

\item As part of Data Management team, designed a robust data ingestion and pre-processing pipeline for research and production environments. Developed reusable tools to handle O(TeraBytes) of data to be processed with PySpark and injested into research or production pipeline.

\item Developed and currently maintaining a Conda Package for internal dataset abstraction. The package testing is automated through Openshift and Jenkins.

\item Optimized fake data generation script from single process to multi process Python job. This brought time to generate 7TB of data from 12 days to just 15 hours.

\runsubsection{Pronavigator.io}
\descript{| Software Engineer (Machine Learning) }
\location{August 2018 - June 2019 | Kitchener, ON}
\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
\begin{tightemize}

\item Implemented complete migration from SVM pipeline to Deep Neural Network model pipeline after showing through a research report that NNs perform better as compared to SVMs.  This migration saved significant servers cost per month and gained a huge performance increase. 
-
\item Improved the machine learning pipeline by implementing a Confusion Matrix tailored to text classification needs of NLU engine of Pronavigator. This provided a sight into correlations between different kinds of user messages. A performance increase of 7 to 10\% was evident because owing to more context driven confusion matrix data was cleaned accordingly.
