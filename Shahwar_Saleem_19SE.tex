% IMPORTANT: THIS TEMPLATE NEEDS TO BE COMPILED WITH XeLaTeX
%
% This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by
% default. If you get compilation errors saying a font is missing, find the line
% on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
% operating system or comment the line out to use the default font.

% 
% TODO:
% 1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.
% 2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
% 3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
% 4. Add location/address information
% 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.
% 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% CHANGELOG:
% v1.1:
% 1. Fixed several compilation bugs with \renewcommand
% 2. Got Open-source fonts (Windows/Linux support)
% 3. Added Last Updated
% 4. Move Title styling into .sty
% 5. Commented .sty file.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Known Issues:
% 1. Overflows onto second page if any column's contents are more than the
% vertical limit
% 2. Hacky space on the first bullet point on the second column.

\runsubsection{Pronavigator.io}
\descript{| Software Engineer (Machine Learning) }
\location{August 2018 - Present | Kitchener, ON}
\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
\begin{tightemize}

\item Prepared a research report and an example model to show that Fully Connected Neural Networks perform better than SVMs because of increased number of classes every day. Executed migration which saved significant servers cost per month and gained a huge performance increase. 

\item Improved the machine learning pipeline by implementing a Confusion Matrix tailored to text classification needs of NLU engine of Pronavigator. This provided a sight into correlations between different kinds of user messages.

\runsubsection{WISE Lab, UWaterloo}
\descript{| Graduate Research Assistant }
\location{May 2017 â€“ Apr 2018 | Waterloo, ON}
\begin{tightemize}

\item Delivered successful autonomous stack of ROS/QNX (OS layers) on ARM based architecture after porting on newly made development boards called H3 by Renesas. Lead Autonmoose Integration team in CES'17. 

\item Improved Autonomous vehicle stack by implementing different components in ROS. Components like system monitor, risk monitor were a part of my contributions. 

\item Used Neural Networks to detect camera occlusion on Autonomous Vehicle. Occlusion detection was reported to a ROS based architecture to warn system about non-friendly environment/situations for vehicle safety. The results were used in publication.
